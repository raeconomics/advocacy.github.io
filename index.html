        <p class="about-text">Welcome to our website, where our mission is to bridge the racial gap in private market
          funding and foster an inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem. We believe that diversity is a catalyst for
          innovation, and we are committed to
          leveling the playing field for minority entrepreneurs who have historically been marginalized.</p>

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="box"> The racial disparity in private market funding is stark. Despite representing a significant
        portion of the population, Black and Latinx entrepreneurs receive a disproportionately small share of venture
        capital and private equity investments.</div>
      <div class="box" style="padding:5px">
        <div class="parent">
          According to a 2020 report by the Harvard Business School, Black entrepreneurs received only 1% of venture
          capital funding, while Latinx entrepreneurs received just 1.8%. In contrast, white entrepreneurs secured 77%
          of
          the funding.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <div class="flex-item">
          This disparity is further reflected in the broader landscape of startup investments. The 2021 Diversity in
          Startups report by RateMyInvestor and Diversity VC found that only 2.4% of venture capital dollars went to
          Black-founded startups, and Latinx founders received 1.7% of the funding. These figures illustrate a
          persistent
          inequity that stifles innovation and economic growth.</p>
